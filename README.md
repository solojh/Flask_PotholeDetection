## Flask Pothole Detection with Image Classification

This project utilizes image classification to detect various road conditions, including plain road, cracks, patches, and potholes, using Flask as a web application framework.

## Introduction

This project aims to assist in road maintenance by detecting various road conditions from images captured using a camera. By utilizing machine learning techniques, it categorizes road conditions into four classes: plain road, cracks, patches, and potholes. The system provides a user-friendly interface via a web application built with Flask, enabling users to upload images and receive real-time analysis of road conditions.

1. **Data Collection** – Captured on-road driving videos around Johor Bahru using car-mounted cameras.
2. **Image Annotation & Processing** – 
   - Extracted video frames
   - Performed image filtering and cropping for model input
3. **Model Training & Evaluation** –
   - Trained a model using the image dataset
   - Validated and tested detection accuracy pothole on road

## Features

- Image classification of road conditions: plain road, cracks, patches, and potholes.
- Web interface for uploading images and receiving analysis results.
