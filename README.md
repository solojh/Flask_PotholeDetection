Flask Pothole Detection with Image Classification

This project utilizes image classification to detect various road conditions, including plain road, cracks, patches, and potholes, using Flask as a web application framework.

## Introduction

This project aims to assist in road maintenance by detecting various road conditions from images captured using a camera. By utilizing machine learning techniques, it categorizes road conditions into four classes: plain road, cracks, patches, and potholes. The system provides a user-friendly interface via a web application built with Flask, enabling users to upload images and receive real-time analysis of road conditions.

## Features

- Image classification of road conditions: plain road, cracks, patches, and potholes.
- Web interface for uploading images and receiving analysis results.
- Real-time processing and display of classification results.
